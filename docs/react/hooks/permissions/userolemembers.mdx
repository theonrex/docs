Hook for getting all wallet addresses that have a specific role in a smart contract.

Available to use on contracts that implement the [PermissionsEnumerable](/solidity/extension-contracts/permissions) interface.

```jsx
import { useRoleMembers } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { data, isLoading, error } = useRoleMembers(contract, "{{role_name}}");
```

## Usage

Provide your contract instance from the [`useContract`](react/hooks/usecontract) and role name as the arguments.

```jsx
import { useContract, useRoleMembers } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address (must implement permission controls)
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

const roleName = "admin";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useRoleMembers(contract, roleName);
}
```

## Configuration

import { useContract, useRoleMembers } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address (must implement permission controls)
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// highlight-next-line
const roleName = "admin";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useRoleMembers(
    contract,
