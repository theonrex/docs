Hook to check if an address is a member of a role on a smart contract.

Available to use on contracts that implement [Permission Controls](/solidity/extension-contracts/permissions).

```jsx
import { useIsAddressRole } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const isMember = useIsAddressRole(
  contract,
  "{{role_name}}",
  "{{wallet_address}}",
);
```

## Usage

Provide the following arguments to the hook:

1. `contract` - The contract instance to check the role on.
2. `roleName` - The name of the role to check.
3. `address` - The wallet address to see if it is a member of the role.

```jsx
import { useIsAddressRole, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address (must implement permission controls)
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// Address of the wallet to check
const walletAddress = "{{wallet_address}}";

// Name of the role to check
const roleName = "admin";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const isMember = useIsAddressRole(contract, roleName, walletAddress);
}
```

const roleName = "admin";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  // Address of the wallet to check
  const isMember = useIsAddressRole(
    contract,
    // highlight-next-line

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  // Address of the wallet to check
