import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

Hook to get the total count of **unique** NFTs minted on a smart contract.

Available to use on smart contracts that implement the [ERC721](/solidity/interfaces/erc721)
or [ERC1155](/solidity/interfaces/erc1155) standard.

When used for ERC1155 contracts, the total count is the number of unique token IDs minted, _not_ the total supply of all tokens in circulation.

```jsx
import { useTotalCount } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { data, isLoading, error } = useTotalCount(contract);
```

## Usage

Provide your NFT contract from the [`useContract`](/react/react.usecontract) hook as the first argument.

```jsx
import { useTotalCount, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data: totalCount, isLoading, error } = useTotalCount(contract);
}
```
