Hook for fetching batches of lazy-minted NFTs that were set to be revealed at a later date, but have not yet been revealed.

Available to use on contracts that implement the
[ERC721Revealable](https://portal.thirdweb.com/solidity/interfaces/erc721revealable)
or [ERC1155Revealable](https://portal.thirdweb.com/solidity/interfaces/erc1155revealable)
interfaces, such as the [NFT Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC721) and
[Edition Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC1155) smart contracts.

```jsx
import { useBatchesToReveal } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { data, isLoading, error } = useBatchesToReveal(contract);
```

## Usage

Provide your NFT collection smart contract from the [`useContract`](/react/react.usecontract) hook as the argument.

```jsx
import { useBatchesToReveal, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  // Contract must implement the Delayed reveal interface.
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data: batches, isLoading, error } = useBatchesToReveal(contract);
}
```
