Hook for getting the platform fee settings of a contract.

Available to use on contracts that implement the [PlatformFee](/solidity/extension-contracts/platformfee) interface.

```jsx
import { usePlatformFees } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { data, isLoading, error } = usePlatformFees(contract);
```

## Usage

Provide your contract instance as the argument.

```jsx
import { useContract, usePlatformFees } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address (must implement PlatformFee)
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = usePlatformFees(contract);
}
```

## Return Value

  <summary>Return Value</summary>
  <div>

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, is an object containing two fields:

- `platform_fee_basis_points`: the platform fee basis points set on the contract
- `platform_fee_recipient`: the wallet address of the platform fee recipient

_Note_: The basis points are in percentage format, meaning that a value of `500` is equivalent to a `5%` fee.

```ts
{
  platform_fee_basis_points: number;
  platform_fee_recipient: string;
}
```

</div>
