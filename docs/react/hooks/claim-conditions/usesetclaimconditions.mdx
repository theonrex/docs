Hook for setting claim conditions on a drop contract.

Available for contracts that implement the [claim conditions](/solidity/interfaces/erc721claimablewithconditions)
interface; such as [NFT Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC721), [Edition Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC1155),
and [Token Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC20).

```jsx
import { useSetClaimConditions } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { mutateAsync, isLoading, error } = useSetClaimConditions(contract);
```

## Usage

Provide your drop contract instance as the argument.

When using an ERC1155 contract, you must also
provide the token ID of the NFT you want to
set claim conditions on as the second parameter to the hook.

```jsx
import {
  useSetClaimConditions,
  useContract,
  Web3Button,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const {
    mutateAsync: setClaimConditions,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useSetClaimConditions(contract);

  return (
    <Web3Button
      contractAddress={contractAddress}
      action={() =>
        setClaimConditions({
          phases: [
            {
              metadata: {
                name: "Phase 1", // The name of the phase
              },
              currencyAddress: "0x...", // The address of the currency you want users to pay in
              price: 1, // The price of the token in the currency specified above
              maxClaimablePerWallet: 1, // The maximum number of tokens a wallet can claim
              maxClaimableSupply: 100, // The total number of tokens that can be claimed in this phase
              startTime: new Date(), // When the phase starts (i.e. when users can start claiming tokens)
              waitInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // The period of time users must wait between repeat claims
              snapshot: [
                {
                  address: "0x...", // The address of the wallet
                  currencyAddress: "0x...", // Override the currency address this wallet pays in
                  maxClaimable: 5, // Override the maximum number of tokens this wallet can claim
                  price: 0.5, // Override the price this wallet pays
                },
              ],
              merkleRootHash: "0x...", // The merkle root hash of the snapshot
            },
          ],
        })
      }
    >
      Set Claim Conditions
    </Web3Button>
  );
}
```

## Configuration

The function takes in two arguments:

1. `reset` - A boolean that determines whether to reset the claim conditions.
   This means you reset any previous claim conditions that existed and allow users to claim again as if the drop had just started.
2. `phases` - An array of claim phases that occur in chronological order.
   You can only have one phase occur at a time.
   All properties of a phase are **optional**, with the default being a free, open,
   unlimited claim, in the native currency, starting immediately.

### reset (optional)

A boolean value that determines whether to reset the claim conditions or to keep the existing state.

By resetting them, any previous claims that were made will be ignored by the claim condition restrictions.

For example, if you had a limit of 1 token per wallet, and a user claimed a token, then you reset the claim conditions, that user will be able to claim another token.

Default value is `false`.

### phases (required)

Provide an array of phases that occur in chronological order.

Below, each property of a phase is described. Each property is optional.

<details>
  <summary>metadata</summary>
  <div>

### metadata

An object representing the metadata of the phase.

This is only for display purposes in the dashboard and isn&rsquo;t used elsewhere.

```jsx
{
  name: string;
}
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>currencyAddress</summary>
  <div>

### currencyAddress

The address of the currency you want users to pay in.

This can be any ERC20 token value.
If you want users to pay in the native currency (e.g. Ether on Ethereum),
you can import the `NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS` constant from `@thirdweb-dev/sdk`.

The default value is `NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS`.

```jsx
import {
  useSetClaimConditions,
  useContract,
  Web3Button,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// highlight-next-line
import { NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const {
    mutateAsync: setClaimConditions,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useSetClaimConditions(contract);

  return (
    <Web3Button
      contractAddress={contractAddress}
      action={() =>
        setClaimConditions({
          phases: [
            {
              // highlight-next-line
              currencyAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
            },
          ],
        })
      }
    >
      Set Claim Conditions
    </Web3Button>
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>price</summary>
  <div>

### price

The price per token in the currency specified above.

The default value is `0`.

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>maxClaimablePerWallet</summary>
  <div>

### maxClaimablePerWallet

The maximum number of tokens a wallet can claim.

The default value is `unlimited`.

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>maxClaimableSupply</summary>
  <div>

### maxClaimableSupply

The total number of tokens that can be claimed in this phase.

For example, if you lazy mint 1000 tokens and set the `maxClaimableSupply` to 100,
then only 100 tokens will be claimable in this phase, leaving 900 tokens to be claimed in the next phases (if you have any).

This is useful for "early bird" use cases, where you allow users to claim a limited number of tokens at a discounted price during
the first X amount of time.

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>startTime</summary>
  <div>

### startTime

When the phase starts (i.e. when users can start claiming tokens).

The default value is immediately.

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>waitInSeconds</summary>
  <div>

### waitInSeconds

The amount of time between claims a wallet must wait before they can claim again.

The default value is `0`, meaning users can claim again immediately after claiming.

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>snapshot</summary>
  <div>

### snapshot

A list of wallets that you want to override the default claim conditions for.

Wallet addresses within this list can be set to pay in a
different currency, have a different price, and have a different maximum claimable amount.

```ts
{
  address: string;
  currencyAddress?: string;
  maxClaimable?: number;
  price?: number;
}
```

### merkleRootHash

If you want to provide your own merkle tree for your snapshot, provide the merkle root hash here.

This is only recommended for advanced use cases.
