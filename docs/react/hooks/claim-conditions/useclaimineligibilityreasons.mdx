import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

Hook for fetching the reasons a wallet is not eligible to claim tokens from a drop, if any.

Available for contracts that implement the [claim conditions](/solidity/interfaces/erc721claimablewithconditions)
interface; such as [NFT Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC721), [Edition Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC1155),
and [Token Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC20).

```jsx
import { useClaimIneligibilityReasons } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { data, isLoading, error } = useClaimIneligibilityReasons(contract, {
  walletAddress: "{{wallet_address}}",
  quantity: 1,
});
```

## Usage

Provide your Drop contract as the argument.

```jsx
import { useClaimIneligibilityReasons, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useClaimIneligibilityReasons(contract, {
    walletAddress: "{{wallet_address}}", // Use useAddress hook to get the user's wallet address
    quantity: 1, // Quantity to check eligibility for
  });
}
```

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>eligibilityParams (required)</summary>
  <div>

The conditions to check eligibility for. The `walletAddress` and `quantity` properties are required.

Use the [`useaddress`](/react/react.useAddress) hook to get the connected wallet address.

```jsx
import { useClaimIneligibilityReasons, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  // highlight-next-line
  const address = useAddress();

  const { data, isLoading, error } = useClaimIneligibilityReasons(
    contract,
    // highlight-start
    {
      walletAddress: address || "",
      quantity: 1,
    },
    // highlight-end
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>tokenId (ERC1155)</summary>
  <div>

When using ERC1155 contracts, provide a third argument to specify the token ID.

```jsx
import { useClaimIneligibilityReasons, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// highlight-next-line
const tokenId = 1;

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useClaimIneligibilityReasons(
    contract,
    {
      walletAddress: "{{wallet_address}}",
      quantity: 1,
    },
    // highlight-next-line
    tokenId,
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>

## Return Value

<details>
  <summary>Return Value</summary>
  <div>

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, contains an array of `ClaimEligibility` strings, which may be empty.

For example, if the user is not in the allowlist, this hook will return `["This address is not on the allowlist."]`.

If the user _is_ eligible to claim tokens, the hook will return an empty array.

```ts
ClaimEligibility[]

// ClaimEligibility Enum
export enum ClaimEligibility {
  NotEnoughSupply = "There is not enough supply to claim.",

  AddressNotAllowed = "This address is not on the allowlist.",

  WaitBeforeNextClaimTransaction = "Not enough time since last claim transaction. Please wait.",

  AlreadyClaimed = "You have already claimed the token.",

  NotEnoughTokens = "There are not enough tokens in the wallet to pay for the claim.",

  NoActiveClaimPhase = "There is no active claim phase at the moment. Please check back in later.",

  NoClaimConditionSet = "There is no claim condition set.",

  NoWallet = "No wallet connected.",

  Unknown = "No claim conditions found.",
}
```

</div>
</details>
