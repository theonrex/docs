Hook for getting the active claim condition on a drop contract for a specific wallet address.

As part of our [improved claim conditions](https://blog.thirdweb.com/announcing-improved-claim-conditions/) update, each wallet address can
have unique claim conditions at any given time. This hook allows you to get the active claim condition for a specific wallet address at this time.

Available for contracts that implement the [claim conditions](/solidity/interfaces/erc721claimablewithconditions)
interface; such as [NFT Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC721), [Edition Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC1155),
and [Token Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC20).

```jsx
import { useActiveClaimConditionForWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { data, isLoading, error } = useActiveClaimConditionForWallet(
  contract,
  "{{wallet_address}}",
);
```

## Usage

Provide your drop contract as the first argument to the hook.

- Returns the claim condition specific to the wallet address if found in the claimer snapshot.
- Returns the default claim condition on the contract if the address is not found in the claimer snapshot.
- Populates the `error` field if there is no active claim condition on the contract.

```jsx
import {
  useActiveClaimConditionForWallet,
  useContract,
  useAddress,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  // Contract can be any contract that implements claim conditions.
  // Including ERC721, ERC1155, and ERC20 drop contracts.
  const address = useAddress();
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useActiveClaimConditionForWallet(
    contract,
    address,
  );
}
```

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>address (required)</summary>
  <div>

### address (required)

The second parameter is the `address` of the wallet you want to get the active claim condition for.

Use the [`useAddress`](/react/react.useaddress) hook to get the currently connected wallet address.

```jsx
import {
  useActiveClaimConditionForWallet,
  useContract,
  // highlight-next-line
  useAddress,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  // highlight-next-line
  const address = useAddress();

  const { data, isLoading, error } = useActiveClaimConditionForWallet(
    contract,
    // highlight-next-line
    address,
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>tokenId (ERC1155 only)</summary>
  <div>

### tokenId (ERC1155 only)

When using the hook with ERC1155 contracts, pass the `tokenId` as the third parameter; as each token can have unique claim conditions.

Pass `undefined`, or leave this field out if you are using ERC721 or ERC20 drop contracts.

```jsx
import {
  useActiveClaimConditionForWallet,
  useContract,
  useAddress,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const address = useAddress();

  const { data, isLoading, error } = useActiveClaimConditionForWallet(
    contract,
    address,
    // highlight-start
    0, // Token ID required for ERC1155 contracts here.
    // highlight-end
  );
}
```

</div>
</details>
