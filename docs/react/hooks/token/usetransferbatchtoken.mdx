Hook for transferring ERC20 tokens to multiple recipients in a single transaction (i.e. airdrop).

Available to use on contracts that implement the [ERC20](https://portal.thirdweb.com/solidity/interfaces/erc20) interface.

The wallet that initiates this transaction must have sufficient balance to cover the total amount of tokens being transferred
and must have transfer permissions on the contract, i.e. tokens are not soulbound.

```jsx
import { useTransferBatchToken } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const { mutateAsync, isLoading, error } = useTransferBatchToken(contract);
```

## Usage

Provide your token contract instance from the [`useContract`](/react/react.usecontract) hook to the hook.

Then, provide an array of objects with the `to` and `amount` properties to the function.

```jsx
import {
  useTransferBatchToken,
  useContract,
  Web3Button,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "token");
  const {
    mutateAsync: transferBatchToken,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useTransferBatchToken(contract);

  return (
    <Web3Button
      contractAddress={contractAddress}
      action={() =>
        transferBatchToken([
          {
            to: "{{wallet_address}}", // Transfer 10 tokens to a wallet
            amount: 10,
          },
          {
            to: "{{wallet_address}}", // Transfer 20 tokens to another wallet
            amount: 20,
          },
        ])
      }
    >
      Transfer Batch Tokens
    </Web3Button>
  );
}
```
