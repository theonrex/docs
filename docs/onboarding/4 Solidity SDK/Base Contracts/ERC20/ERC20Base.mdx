# ERC20 Base

The `ERC20Base` smart contract implements the [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) standard.
Additionally, it supports [EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612), allowing approvals to be made via signatures.

## Functions to Override

The following functions have been implemented on this contract & are available to be overridden to add custom logic:

<details>
<summary>mintTo</summary>
<div>

```solidity
    /**
     *  @notice          Lets an authorized address mint tokens to a recipient.
     *  @dev             The logic in the `_canMint` function determines whether the caller is authorized to mint tokens.
     *
     *  @param _to       The recipient of the tokens to mint.
     *  @param _amount   Quantity of tokens to mint.
     */
    function mintTo(address _to, uint256 _amount) public virtual {
        require(_canMint(), "Not authorized to mint.");
        require(_amount != 0, "Minting zero tokens.");

        _mint(_to, _amount);
    }
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>burn</summary>
<div>

```solidity
    /**
     *  @notice          Lets an owner a given amount of their tokens.
     *  @dev             Caller should own the `_amount` of tokens.
     *
     *  @param _amount   The number of tokens to burn.
     */
    function burn(uint256 _amount) external virtual {
        require(balanceOf(msg.sender) >= _amount, "not enough balance");
        _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    }
```
