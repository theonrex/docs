# Interfaces

<div className="heroGrid">
<div>
  <p>
The interfaces provide a representation of contracts and extensions present in the Solidity SDK. They also serve as a means to interact with contracts that implement these extensions.
  </p>
<p>
You will find here the list of all interfaces and references implementations using each of these.
</p>

We provide interfaces for [ERC721](/solidity/interfaces/erc721), [ERC1155](/solidity/interfaces/erc1155), and
[ERC20](/solidity/interfaces/erc20); each representing various features depending on your use case.

You can implement these features by inheriting these interfaces and providing a custom implementation for inherited functions.
