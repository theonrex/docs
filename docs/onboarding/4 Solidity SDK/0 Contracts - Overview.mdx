        Build custom smart contracts using audited and gas-optimized [base-contracts](/solidity/base-contracts) and [Extensions](/solidity/extensions) as the building-blocks.
    </p>

Unlock smarter [SDKs](/sdk), custom admin [Dashboards](/dashboard) and tailored data feeds by using:

- **Base Contracts** that you can build upon, such as [ERC721Base](/solidity/base-contracts/erc-721/erc721base).
- **Extension contracts** that you can add to contracts to unlock specific functionality, such as [Permission Controls](/solidity/extensions/permissions) and [Royalty Fees](/solidity/extensions/royalty).

:::info Solana Programs

Rust SDK is coming to Solana soon!

In the meantime, you can use the [programs](/solana/creating-programs) we have available.

:::

To get started, run the following command to create a new project:

```bash
npx thirdweb create contract
```

Or, install the `contracts` package into your existing Solidity project:

```bash
forge install thirdweb-dev/contracts
```

```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/contracts
```

## Why Use the Solidity SDK?

Each Extensions you implement in your smart contract unlocks functionality in both the dashboard and SDK to help you build applications on top of them.

For example, if you implement the [ERC721Base](/solidity/base-contracts/erc-721/erc721base) contract which inherits from multiple extensions inclusing [ERC721Mintable](/solidity/extensions/erc721mintable), you'll unlock the `mint` button in the dashboard and
can use the [mint](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/erc721mintable) function in the SDK; which automatically uploads and pins your metadata to IPFS!

## Using the Solidity SDK

The Solidity SDK can be used to build a new smart contracts _end-to-end_, or to add Extensions to your own, existing smart contract.

### Using Base Contracts

The Solidity SDK includes [**base contracts**](/solidity/base-contracts) that are fully complete smart contracts that can be customized by overriding functions OR by adding Extensions.

**1.** To start, import and inherit the base contract. You can find the list of all available base contracts [here](/solidity/base-contracts#list-of-base-contracts).

**2.** Base contracts expect certain constructor arguments to function as intended. Implement a constructor for your smart contract and pass the
appropriate values to the constructor of your base contract.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721Base {
    constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _royaltyRecipient,
        uint128 _royaltyBps
    ) ERC721Base(_name, _symbol, _royaltyRecipient, _royaltyBps) {}
}
```

**3.** Now you're all set up! ðŸŽ‰ Your smart contract now has all the [Extensions](/solidity/extensions) provided by the [base contract](/solidity/base-contracts/) it inherits and is ready to be deployed to any EVM blockchain of your choice.

### Using Extension Contracts

Additional [**Extensionss**](/solidity/extensions) can be added to your smart contract, exisiting or to the [**base contracts**](/solidity/base-contracts) to add extra functionality and unlocking features in the SDKs and Dashboard.

**1.** To start, import and inherit the Extension. You can find the list of all available extensions [here](/solidity/extensions#list-of-extensions).

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol";
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/Permissions.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721Base, Permissions {
    constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _royaltyRecipient,
        uint128 _royaltyBps
    ) ERC721Base(_name, _symbol, _royaltyRecipient, _royaltyBps) {}
}
```

**Note:** 
- Some Extensions are __Abstract__ and so require certain functions to be implemented*.
- Some Extensions are __Interfaces__ and so require **all** the functions to be implemented*.

*implement = write the logic for the function with a matching function signature (matching name, parameters, visibility and return type)

**2.** Use the functions provided by the Extension to change the behaviour of your smart contract.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol";
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/Permissions.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721Base, Permissions {
    bytes32 private constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");

    constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _royaltyRecipient,
        uint128 _royaltyBps
    ) ERC721Base(_name, _symbol, _royaltyRecipient, _royaltyBps) {}

    /**
     *  `_canMint` is a function available in `ERC721Base`.
     *
     *  It is called every time a wallet tries to mint NFTs on this
     *  contract, and lets you define the condition in which an
     *  attempt to mint NFTs should be permitted, or rejected.
     *
     *  By default, `ERC721Base` only lets the contract's owner mint
     *  NFTs. Here, we override that functionality.
     *
     *  We use the `Permissions` extension to specify that anyone holding
     *  "MINTER_ROLE" should be able to mint NFTs.
     */
    function _canMint() internal view override returns (bool) {
        return hasRole(MINTER_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }
}
```
