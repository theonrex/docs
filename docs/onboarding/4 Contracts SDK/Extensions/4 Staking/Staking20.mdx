# Staking ERC20 Tokens

```solidity

```

<p>Setup staking feature for your ERC20 tokens.</p>

The `Staking20` smart contract extension implements ERC20 staking mechanism. With this extension you can setup a staking contract for holders of your ERC20 tokens. Users can stake their tokens and earn a different set of ERC20 tokens as rewards.

## Availability in base contracts

The `Staking20` is _already_ available in the following [base contracts](/contractkit/base-contracts).

- **ERC20**: [`Staking20Base`](/contractkit/base-contracts/staking/staking20base)

## Implementing the Contract

Import the contract and make your contract inherit it.

## Full API Reference

### stake

```solidity
function stake(uint256 amount) external;
```

- Lets a user stake a number of ERC20 tokens by passing in amount.
- Parameter `amount`: Amount of tokens to stake.

### withdraw

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external payable;
```

- Un-stake and withdraw tokens from the contract.
- Parameter `amount`: Amount of tokens to withdraw.

### claimRewards

```solidity
function claimRewards() external;
```

- Claim accumulated rewards. This claim method allows for a pull mechanism where users must initiate claiming of rewards.

### getStakeInfo

```solidity
function getStakeInfo(address staker) external view returns (uint256 tokensStaked, uint256 rewards);
```

- View number of tokens staked and total rewards available for a user.
- Parameter `staker`: Account address of staker.

### setRewardRatio

```solidity
function setRewardRatio(uint256 numerator, uint256 denominator) external
```

- Allows an authorized account to set reward ratio. Interpreted as (numerator/denominator) rewards per second/per day/etc based on time-unit. For e.g., ratio of 1/20 would mean 1 reward token for every 20 tokens staked.
- Parameter `numerator`: Reward ratio numerator.
- Parameter `denominator`: Reward ratio denominator.

### setTimeUnit

```solidity
function setTimeUnit(uint256 timeUnit) external;
```

- Allows an authorized account to set time unit as a number of seconds. For e.g. 1 hour can be set as 3600 seconds - setting the reward frequency as _per hour_.
- Parameter `timeUnit`: New time unit.
