# ERC1155 - Lazy Mint

You can utilize these features of the SDK on your contract if it implements [LazyMint](/solidity/extension-contracts/lazymint).

<div className="row" style={{ marginBottom: 24 }}>
  <div className="col col--12" style={{ marginTop: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Learn how to implement LazyMint in your smart contract"
      link={"/solidity/extension-contracts/lazymint"}
      image="/assets/icons/general.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Batch Lazy Mint NFTs

Batch upload NFT metadata to be lazy-minted to the contract.

You can provide metadata objects to have them uploaded and [pinned](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/securing-pinning-your-nft-with-ipfs/)
to IPFS, or provide your own URLs.
