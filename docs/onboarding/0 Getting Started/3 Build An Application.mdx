import TwitterCard from "@components/ShareOnTwitterCard";

Use the [CLI](/cli) to create a web application with the
[React](/react) and [JavaScript](/typescript) SDKs pre-configured:

```bash
npx thirdweb create app --evm
```

This will kick off an interactive series of questions to help you get started:

- Give your project a name
- Select [`Create React App`](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) as the framework
- Select `JavaScript` or `TypeScript` as the language

### Exploring The Project

The `create` command generates a new directory with your project name.
Open this directory in your text editor.

Inside the [`index.js`](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/cra-javascript-starter/blob/main/src/index.js#L15-L17) file,
you'll find the [`ThirdwebProvider`](/sdk/set-up-the-sdk/frontend#manual-installation) wrapping the entire application.

This wrapper allows us to use all of the [React SDK](/react)'s hooks and [UI Components](/react/react.web3button) throughout the application, as well as configure an `activeChain`;
which declares which chain our smart contracts are deployed to.

Since we deployed our smart contract to the `Goerli` network, we'll set the `activeChain` to `"goerli"`:

## Interact With Contracts

To connect to your smart contract in the application,
provide your smart contract address (_which you can get from the dashboard_) to the
[`useContract`](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/custom-contracts/getting-a-contract#connect-to-a-contract)
hook like so:

```jsx title="src/App.js"
import { useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Home() {
  const { contract } = useContract("<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>");

  // Now you can use the contract in the rest of the component!
}
```

You can now call any function on your smart contract with [`useContractRead`](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/custom-contracts/using-contracts#read-contract-data) and
[`useContractWrite`](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/custom-contracts/using-contracts#write-transactions) hooks.
Each [extension](/solidity/extensions) you implemented in your smart contract also
unlocks a new functionality for you to use in the [SDK](/sdk).

Let's look at how this works by reading our smart contract's NFTs and then minting new ones.

### Reading Data

The NFT Collection contract we built earlier implements the [ERC721](/solidity/base-contracts/erc-721/erc721base)
and [ERC721Supply](/solidity/interfaces/erc721supply) extensions.

By doing so, we can use the [View All](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/erc721supply)
functionality in our application! In the React SDK, that is available
through the [`useNFTs`](/react/react.usenfts) hook, which we can use by providing the `contract` object to the hook like so:

```jsx title="src/App.js"
import { useContract, useNFTs } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Home() {
  const { contract } = useContract("<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>");
  const { data: nfts, isLoading: isReadingNfts } = useNFTs(contract);
}
```

### Displaying Data

Use the [NFT Media Renderer](/ui-components/nft-renderer) component to
render each of the NFTs loaded from the `useNFTs` hook, making use of the loading state in a conditional statement:

```jsx title="src/App.js"
import { useContract, useNFTs, ThirdwebNftMedia } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Home() {
  const { contract } = useContract("<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>");
  const { data: nfts, isLoading: isReadingNfts } = useNFTs(contract);

  return (
    <>
      {isReadingNfts ? (
        <p>Loading...</p>
      ) : (
        <div>
          {nfts?.map((nft) => (
            <ThirdwebNftMedia metadata={nft.metadata} key={nft.metadata.id} />
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

### Writing Transactions

Since our smart contract implements the `ERC721Mintable` extension,
the [Mint](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/erc721mintable) feature is available to us in the SDK.

Use the [`Web3Button`](/ui-components/web3button) component to perform a `mint` transaction; which ensures the user
has their wallet connected and is on the right network before calling the function:

```jsx title="src/App.js"
// Place this import at the top of the file
import { Web3Button } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// ...

// Place this beneath your existing NFT display logic:
<Web3Button
  contractAddress={"<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>"}
  action={(contract) =>
    contract.erc721.mint({
      name: "Hello world!",
      // Place any URL or file here!
      image: "<your-image-url-here>",
    })
  }
>
  Mint NFT
</Web3Button>;
```

## Deploy Your App

To [host your application on IPFS](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/how-to-host-your-web-app-on-ipfs/)
and share it with the world, run the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

That's it! ðŸ¥³ This command uses [Storage](/storage) to:

- Create a production build of your application
- Upload the build to IPFS
- Generate a URL where your app is permanently hosted.
