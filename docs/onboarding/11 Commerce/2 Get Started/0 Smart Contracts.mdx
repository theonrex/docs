### Deploying Contracts via Explore

thirdweb [Explore](https://thirdweb.com/explore) is an on-chain registry for smart contracts that can be deployed via one-click on the thirdweb [Dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

### Integrating Smart Contracts via SDK

Applications can interact with smart contracts using thirdweb’s web3 [SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/sdk/interacting-with-contracts). SDK’s are available in a variety of programming languages including:

- [Javascript/Typescript](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript)
- [React](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react)
- [Python](https://portal.thirdweb.com/python)
- [Go](https://portal.thirdweb.com/go)
- [React Native](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react-native)
- [Unity](https://portal.thirdweb.com/unity)

### Creating Custom Contracts with Solidity SDK

If you want to either build a smart contract from scratch or add functionality to existing smart contracts, you can use thirdweb’s [Solidity SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/solidity). Using Solidity SDK, you can:

- Create **Base Contracts**, which give you access to a set of audited, gas optimized smart contracts that you use as the foundation of your smart contract.
- Add **Extensions** to existing contracts, which are individual pieces of functionality you can add to your smart contracts.

By using auto-detection features built into the thirdweb SDK’s, custom contracts can be integrated seamlessly into applications.
